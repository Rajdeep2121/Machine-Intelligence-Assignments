# ASSIGNMENT 3

## Neural Network from Scratch

Implementation for Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation using the concept of Gradient Descent.

Modules used in python3:<br>
> Numpy => for mathematical calculations like dot product and generating random weights and biases at the beginning<br>
> Scikit Learn => ONLY FOR splitting dataset into training and test sets<br>
> Pandas => for handling dataset (cleaning)
